Game Description:
My project is a PvP offline Chess game. It shows the material point differential after each move. The game will also highlight possible moves when the user clicks on a piece and has a reset button to reset the game to default. Game will also handle En passant, pawn promotion, both types of castling, checks and checkmate.

No libraries in addition to CMU graphics are required

Game should be ran from the board.py file

No shortcuts exist
